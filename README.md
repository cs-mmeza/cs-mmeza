### 👋 Hi, I’m **Mauricio Meza** – @cs-mmeza  
Mechatronics & Software Engineer | API Developer | Robotics ⚙️

---

#### 🚀 What I’m Building & Learning
- **API Development** – Designing robust REST services with **Python frameworks** (FastAPI, Django REST, Flask) and clean, test-friendly architecture.  
- **Robotics × CAD** – Integrating **ROS 2** with **Onshape** (FeatureScript, webhooks) to drive digital-twin workflows and automated cell simulations.  
- **Mechatronics** – Prototyping motion-control systems and IoT devices that bridge the physical and digital worlds.  
- **Full-Stack R&D** – Still hacking on Next.js + React when a project calls for sleek UIs or rapid prototyping.

#### 🧰 Toolbox & Tech Highlights
`Python` · `FastAPI` · `Django REST` · `Flask`  
`Java` · `Spring Boot` · `Node.js` · `TypeScript`  
`ROS 2` · `Onshape FeatureScript` · `SolidWorks` · `C++` (embedded)  
`PostgreSQL` · `MongoDB` · `Docker` · `GitHub Actions` · `AWS`

#### 🔭 Current Focus
1. **CAD-Aware Robotics Pipelines** – Auto-generating URDF/XACRO from Onshape models and deploying them in Gazebo / MoveIt 2.  
2. **High-Throughput REST APIs** – Applying Hexagonal Architecture and CQRS patterns for testability and performance.  
3. **Smart Automation** – Combining PLC data, computer vision, and cloud services for real-time factory insights.

#### 🌱 Always Curious About
- Path-planning and advanced kinematics for 6-axis arms  
- Digital manufacturing (additive + subtractive) workflows  
- Developer-friendly documentation & DX tooling
