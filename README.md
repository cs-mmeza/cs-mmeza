👋 Hi, I’m Mauricio Meza @cs-mmeza, a Mechatronics enthusiast with a strong background in automation for industrial systems and mechanical design.

🌐 Passionate about the intersection of technology and everyday life, I'm currently exploring the realms of app and web development to understand how these innovations shape our daily routines.

💡 My journey involves delving into Fullstack technologies, honing my skills with React.js and Node.js to create dynamic and efficient websites and mobile applications.

🎯 On a mission to transition into the role of a Software Engineer, I am eager to contribute my expertise while continually building my knowledge and experience in this dynamic field.
